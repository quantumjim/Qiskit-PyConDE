# Quantum computing with Python

This repository holds materials for the [Quantum computing with Python](https://de.pycon.org/program/pydata-re99db-quantum-computing-with-python-james-wootton/) tutorial session at the PyConDE and PyData Berlin conference. If you want to execute code during the tutorial, [download this repository](https://github.com/quantumjim/Qiskit-PyConDE/archive/master.zip).

The presentation will use the following notebooks.

* [The Atoms of Computation](atoms-computation.ipynb)
* [Playing with a qubit on a PewPew](PewPew-Qubit.ipynb)
* [Quantum Procedural Generation on a PewPew](Terrain-Hackathon.ipynb)

These are adaptions of resources from the [Qiskit textbook](https://community.qiskit.org/textbook) (source notebooks [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-textbook/blob/master/README.md)), and [MicroQiskit](https://github.com/quantumjim/MicroQiskit/blob/master/README.md).

These resources mix standard Qiskit and Microqiskit. Hopefully it doesn't get confusing!

## Get Ready

### Plan A - Run on your own device

* [Download](https://github.com/quantumjim/Qiskit-PyConDE/archive/master.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/quantumjim/Qiskit-PyConDE.git) this repository.

* Install [these packages](requirements.txt) (for Python 3).

* Open the Jupyter notebooks found in the *Qiskit-PyConDE* folder.


### Plan B - Run on our cloud service

* Go to the [IBM Q Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and create a (free) account.

* Use our web-hosted notebooks [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter).

* Upload the [The Atoms of Computation](atoms-computation.ipynb) notebook.


### Plan C - Don't run anything!

* Just sit back, enjoy the presentation, and save the fun for afterwards.
